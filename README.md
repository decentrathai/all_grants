📚 Background

Raising money for a Web3 startup can feel like playing 4‑D chess blindfolded. After helping dozens of teams pitch everyone from the Ethereum Foundation to Tiger‑backed crypto funds, we noticed the same patterns:

* 80 % of application forms ask the **exact** same questions – only the wording changes.
* Founders waste cycles rewriting the same answers instead of building.
* Contact info for the “right” funds sits in scattered Notion docs.

So we open‑sourced our internal playbook. Use it, critique it, extend it.
